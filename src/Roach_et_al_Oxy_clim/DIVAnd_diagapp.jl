     errormap=DIVAnd_diagapp(P,pmn,len,sv)

Calculates an appriximation to the error map exploiting the fact that inv(P) is available via a cholesky decomposition Q'C*C'Q where Q is a permutation matrix. The diagonal component i  is then z'*z where z= inv(Q'C)  ei where ei is normally an array with zeros except in position i where it has a value of 1. Here we exploit that z in that case have only values in specific locations and hence if there is another 1 in ei at a very different location, we can make two calculation at the price of one by summing up the relevant parts of z'z only. And of course you can repeat the reasoning and covering the domain with well placed ones. Advantage compared to AEXERR: works with any number of data points. Should be particularly efficient in higher dimensions and situations where len are small compared to the domain size.
# WARNING: if you provide the wheretocalculate array it WILL BE CHANGED IN PLACE



# Input

* `P` : is the covariance matrix found in the structure s from the analysis s.P`
* `pmn` : are the metrics of the grid
* `len` : the length scales used
* `sv` : the statevector from structure s : s.sv
* `wheretocalculate` : a boolean array of the same dimensions as pmn[1] specifying if in a point the error is to be calculated. Default is everywhere

# Output

* `errormap` : array of the same dimensions as the analysis including the error variance at the point, relative to the background variance.
